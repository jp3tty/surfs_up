## Overview of Analysis

This analysis reviews the weather conditions around Oahu, Hawaii to determine if a surf and ice cream shop can sustain steady business year-round. The monthly temperatures and precipication from the dataset, provided in a SQLite database, will help make this determination through SQLAlchemy queries, in a Jupyter notebook. Ideally, consistent warm weather and just enough rainfall to keep everything green will be the optimal condition for sustaining a surf and ice cream shop.


## Results
Two classes, "measurement" and "station," from the SQLite database provide all the information required to conduct the analysis. Temperature and precipitaction info was gather from the measurement class and the locations information was assessed through the station class.
